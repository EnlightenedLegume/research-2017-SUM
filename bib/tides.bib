Probably one of the oldest suites of code, it was first published in 1987. Most 
everything is written in Fortran 77, with bits in C and UNIX. Perhaps a ``jumping
off'' point for me. Find it at https://igppweb.ucsd.edu/~agnew/Spotl/spotlmain.html"

force on a point on the earth, effectively giving a tidal prediction based on
